# LoL-Predicting-Duration
We examine the 2022 League of Legends data set and aim to predict the duration of a game. We generate 2 models: a simple baseline model that uses 2 features, a final model that incorporates feature engineering. We also conduct a fairness analysis test to check the parity of our model.
